Dear #{h(@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & "))},


We regret to inform you that your proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' has not been selected to be part of the program of #{AppConfig[:conference_name]}.

We have received a lot of very interesting proposals this year. Sadly, this means that many good proposals could not be included in the program due to lack of space. You may see the feedback that your proposal has received from the reviewers and track organizers at:

= link_to session_reviews_url(@session, :locale => 'en'), session_reviews_url(@session, :locale => 'en')

We hope you decide to participate in this event and consider proposing this session during the Open Space day at the conference.

Should you have any queries, requests or comments, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at 'agiles2011-program@agiles.org'.

Thank you very much for your proposal. We hope you do attend the conference this year and bring new proposals for the next year.


Sincerely,

#{"--"}

Program Committee of #{AppConfig[:conference_name]} Conference
