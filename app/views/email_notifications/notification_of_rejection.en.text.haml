Dear #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")},


We regret to inform you that your proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' has not been selected to be part of the program of the #{@conference_name} conference.


We have received around 200 proposals this year -- more proposals than any other Brazilian conference about agile methods. Sadly, this means that many good proposals could not be included in the program due to lack of space. You may see the feedback that your proposal has received from the reviewers and track organizers at:

= session_reviews_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


Should you have any queries, requests or comments, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at agiles2012-program@agiles.org.


Thank you very much for your proposal. We hope you do attend the conference this year and bring new proposals for the next year.


Sincerely,

#{"--"}

Program Committee of #{@conference_name} Conference
