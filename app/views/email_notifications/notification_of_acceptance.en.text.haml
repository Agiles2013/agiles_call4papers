Dear #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")},


Please refer to the comments and suggestions made by the evaluators accessing:

We are pleased to inform you that your proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' has been selected to be part of the program of the #{@conference_name} conference!


We would like to ask you to confirm your attendance at the event until #{Ability::AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_DEADLINE.strftime('%H:%M of %B %dth, %Y')} by accessing the form at

= session_confirm_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


If you can not attend the event, we kindly ask you to confirm your withdrawal using the form at

= session_withdraw_url(@session, :locale => 'en')


- if(@session.authors.size > 1)
  Any of the two authors (#{@session.author.full_name} or #{@session.second_author.full_name}) may confirm or withdraw the attendance. Once the attendance is confirmed or withdrawn by any author, none can change the decision.


The sessions whose authors do not confirm or withdraw their attendance until #{Ability::AUTHOR_CONFIRMATION_DEADLINE.strftime('%B %dth, %Y')} will be automatically removed from the program and replaced immediately by other selected work.


If your attendance is confirmed, the organization of #{@conference_name} will contact you about your complementary registration#{@session.authors.size > 1 ? 's' : ''} for the event.


In case you have any queries, requests or comments, please contact the Program Committee at agiles2012-program@agiles.org.


We hope to see you soon!
